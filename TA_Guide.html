</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
required by the University, postgraduate studentship recipients are
required to perform departmental TA duties for not more than 10 hours
per week on average of teaching and/or research support duties as
assigned by the Department. The exact average hours per week depend
on the funding schemes and apply for all weeks of the entire year,
excluding one month of vacation leave and public holidays. Also,
students should be assigned to work with staff other than their
principal supervisor(s). Exceptional cases with strong justification
may be considered.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Before
the semester begins, Course Leaders should provide specific
requirements of the TA duties of their courses, for example, working
date and time, duty descriptions and preferred qualification.
Teaching Assistants should fully understand the work requirements and
duties before submitting their preferences. The Department will
strive to appropriately assign TAs to courses according to their
academic interest and ability, but reserves the right to assign TAs
to any course.</font></p>

</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 108%"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
number of TAs assigned to individual courses will depend on the total
TA workload specified by the Course Leader. In principle, courses
with practical sessions will have no more than 4 TAs, while courses
with only lectures will have no more than 2 TAs. Course Leaders may
request for more TAs with justifications for Programme Leaderâ€™s
consideration.</font></p>

<font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Maintaining frequent
communication between Course Leaders and TAs during the course is
essential. The Course Leaders are responsible for the TA performance
quality. They should work together to enhance the teaching quality
and to achieve the intended course learning outcomes. Any issues
related to the lab practical needs to report to the Course Leader
immediately.</font></p>

Leaders are obligated to clearly define the TA roles and
responsibilities, such as laboratory pre-training and pre-lab talk,
while TAs are also obliged to clearly understand their roles and
responsibilities. Course Leaders are encouraged to provide
constructive feedbacks to TAs on their performance on a regular
basis.</font></p>

TAs have any comments, suggestions or complaints on the course, they
should raise questions immediately to Course Leaders first. If the TA
is not satisfied with the outcome, he/she may discuss the matter with
the Programme Leader. Programme Leader will further report the case
to Head of Department if needed.</font></p>
